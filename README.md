I'm still trying

Hackintosh was running but I have problems with the graphics driver.

Problem #1 I have to use the HDMI port on the RTX3080 to see boot menu and startup logo after that I choose MAC Os in the list it will load untill probably 35% than I need to switch the HDMI cable into the onboard mobo port.

BIOS Settings disabled
Secure boot off
Vt-D off
CSM off
CFG Lock

I tried so many device properties from others but I can't seem to get it to work.
